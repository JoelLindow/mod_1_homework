#Pseudo Code - Bad Connection

#First Greeting should be "HELLO, THIS IS A GROCERY STORE"
#  Caller / User should have an opportunity to input a question or say something.

#ALL RESPONSES FROM THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE IN CAPITALS, INDICATING YELLING (bad connection).

#Response to first question asked by user should be "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU".
#  There should be a question counter (check for question mark on the input)

#Response to second question asked by user should be "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"
#  ^^ This will happen after the question counter hits a value of 2

#If the input is blank (an empty string response) the response to screen should be "HELLO?"
   ^^ No limit to amount of times this response can be given to empty input from user

#Add a "Goodbye Counter"
#If user says goodbye! once the response should be "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU"
#If user says goodbye! twice the response should be "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?"
#If user says goodbye! three times the response should be "THANK YOU FOR CALLING"

#After 3 goodbye!'s and responses from program, the program should end.
